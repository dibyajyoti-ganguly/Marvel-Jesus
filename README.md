# Marvel-Jesus ðŸš€

Your go-to place for all stuff [Marvel Related](http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/3/20/5232158de5b16.jpg).

## Description

A central hub which holds info pertaining to Marvel comics, characters & movies. We have built separate routing configurations considering the three categories of info. Also, built a search bar to search up your favourite marvel character from the list, saving you the time needed to scroll all the way!

# Getting Started with the App

This module informs you about the necessary libraries & dependencies you need to download & install prior to running the app. Also, we get to know the available scripts which can be executed.

## Dependencies

### `Parcel`
The zero configuration build tool for the web. Parcel combines a great out-of-the-box development experience with a scalable architecture that can take your project from just getting started to massive production application. No more fiddling with configuration, or spending hours to keep up with best practices â€“ it just works!

### `React`
React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. 

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. 

### `React-Router`
React Router is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React 18 to React 19. You can use it maximally as a React framework or minimally as a library with your own architecture. Like previous versions, React Router can still be used as a simple, declarative routing library. Its only job will be matching the URL to a set of components, providing access to URL data, and navigating around the app.

This strategy is popular for "Single Page Apps" that have their own frontend infrastructure and v6 apps looking for a stress free upgrade. It's particularly good at offline + sync architectures where pending states are rare and users have long running sessions.

### `Tailwind`
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. Tailwind is unapologetically modern, and takes advantage of all the latest and greatest CSS features to make the developer experience as enjoyable as possible.

### `MD5`
MD5, or Message-Digest Algorithm 5, is a cryptographic hash function that creates a 128-bit "fingerprint" of a string. It's used to verify data integrity, authenticate messages, and create digital signatures. In this project, we use this package to hash our api keys.

## Installing

* How/where to clone the repository:
```
git clone "https://github.com/dibyajyoti-ganguly/Marvel-Jesus.git"
```
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
